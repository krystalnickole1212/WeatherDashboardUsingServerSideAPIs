# WeatherDashboardUsingServerSideAPIs


##Decription:
The Weather Dashboard accesses a weather conditions using APIs and displays them for you to view.  


###Updated and Accomplished

 The Weather Dashboard offers a search bar for users to enter the city where they would like to know more about the weather, the user imput is saved in local storage, and then run through a geocache API to pinpoint a location using latitude and longitude. This is also saved in local storage. 

The latitude and longitude are then supposed to by sent through another weather function fetched through the javascript, and then the weather should be saved in local storage as an array, then displayed on the page. This is a work in progress.
